# SKSmodeling
A work-flow for SKS modeling using FK-SEM injection

# SPECFEM3D
Some modifications have been done with specfem3D, e.g, adding parameters like AZIMUTHAL_ANISOTROPY in Par_file, modifying several files in src/generate_databases to read C21 tomography files and saving the corresponding binary files; modifying src/couple_with_injection.f90 as suggested by Kai.
By running myinstall.sh in specfem3d, you could remake everything and reinstall specfem.
